# Chisel-Learning:

The repository contains the learning journey/getting familiar with Chisel, a framework of Scala. Labs have been implemented, introducing to most of the utilities in Chisel and its related concepts. 

--------------------------------------------------------

## Environment Setting:

This repository contains the code where I trained and practiced Chisel and Scala. The following is the course that should be followed. 

Start by setting up the working enviroment

## Dependencies

#### JDK 8 or newer

LTS releases Java 8 and Java 11 is recommended. You can install the JDK as recommended by your operating system, or use the prebuilt binaries from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

#### SBT 

SBT is the most common built tool in the Scala community. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).  


## Getting started:

Fork this repository on your own individual profiles. After forking clone the repository and run:

```sh
sbt test
```

You should see a whole bunch of output that ends with something like the following lines:

If you see the above then, It worked!

You are ready to go. Next step is to go inside the `docs/` folder where you will find the labs to perform.

### For quick debugging:
If you quickly want to see what verilog is being generated, go to this link  https://bit.ly/3u3zr0e and write Chisel here.

P.S: All the support documents, assignment files and PDF of Scala and Functional Programming can be accessed in [Docs](https://github.com/Agha-Muqarib/Scala-Learning/tree/main/Docs) Folder of the repository.
